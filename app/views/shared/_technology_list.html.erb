<!-- DRY for technology list to be reused in all kind of posts (resources, projects, collaborations, jobs)
whenever you need it use it like this:
= render 'shared/technology_list', post: @xxxxx  -->

<!-- link_to controller, in order to be reutilized for all controllers (instead of _path)
it is redirecting to the current controller index -->
<% post.technology_list.each do |p| %>
<%= link_to p, {controller: controller_name, technology: p }, {class: "btn btn-xs btn-default"} %>
<%end%>
